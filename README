This repository holds the l10n functions used in the german mapnik style.

As these are usable independent from the map style they are now held in its
own repository.

We currently use this code in the German Mapnik style.

Currently this conde consists of three parts:

1. An "Any-Latin" transliterate funtion using libicu
2. A japanese kanji transliterate funtion using libkakasi
3. A couple of PL/pgSQL functions which can be used to generate labels for
   map rendering.

See INSTALL file for installation instructions

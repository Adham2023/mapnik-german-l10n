This repository holds the l10n functions used in the german mapnik style.

As these are usable independent from the map style they are now held in its
own repository.

We currently use this code in the German Mapnik style.

Transliteration is the last resort if no latin name:de, int_name or name:en
has been found by the get_localized_name PL/pgSQL function.

To enable the tranliterate function in your database execute the following
code as database root user:

CREATE FUNCTION transliterate(text) RETURNS text AS '$libdir/utf8translit', 'transliterate' LANGUAGE C STRICT;

Afterwards the function can then be used like this:

mydb=>  select transliterate('Москва́');
 transliterate
---------------
 Moskvá
(1 row)

Afterwards the plpgsql funktions can be enabled using something like this:

 for sql in plpgsql/*; do echo psql -f $sql yourdb; done
